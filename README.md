### **INTRODUCTION**
________________
Major IT technical issues are difficult for businesses to manage. To avoid integration issues, security concerns, and the risk of cyber hacking to their systems and data, check the existing hardware to see if it is compatible with the new technology before installing it in the business. It's time to reconsider the goals of technology and see whether there are any alternatives to internal IT networks. Fortunately, there are further cloud computing possibilities. The emergence of cloud computing gave SMEs the chance to once again take charge of their IT infrastructure. With cloud computing, you can manage every IT issue affecting your business while keeping complete control.
