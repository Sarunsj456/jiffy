### **INTRODUCTION**

Businesses find it challenging to manage significant IT-related technical challenges. Before integrating the new technology into the company, make sure the existing hardware is compatible in order to avoid integration problems, security issues, and the risk of cyber hacking to their systems and data. It's time to reexamine technology's objectives and determine whether there are any options besides internal IT networks. There are fortunately more applications for cloud computing. With the advent of cloud computing, SMEs now have the chance to regain control over their IT infrastructure. You can manage every IT issue affecting your company while maintaining total control with cloud computing.
