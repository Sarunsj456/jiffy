### **INTRODUCTION**
________________
Businesses find it challenging to manage significant IT-related technical challenges. Before integrating the new technology into the company, make sure the existing hardware is compatible in order to avoid integration problems, security issues, and the risk of cyber hacking to their systems and data. It's time to reexamine technology's objectives and determine whether there are any options besides internal IT networks. There are fortunately more applications for cloud computing. With the advent of cloud computing, SMEs now have the chance to regain control over their IT infrastructure. You can manage every IT issue affecting your company while maintaining total control with cloud computing.

## Benefits of cloud 
_____________________
- Accessibility: Cloud services offer unrestricted access to data and programs from any place and on any internet-connected device. Employees may now access resources 
  and work on projects from anywhere in the world, enabling remote work and collaboration while also boosting productivity.
- Collaboration & Flexibility: Teams may work together smoothly using cloud-based collaboration tools and services, sharing and modifying documents in real time. File-sharing and cloud storage solutions offer a central location for information, making it simple to view and collaborate on work from many devices.
- Security: To safeguard infrastructure and data, cloud service companies make significant investments in security measures. To protect against cyber attacks, they use sophisticated encryption, access restrictions, and frequent security upgrades.

This research analyzes the  JIFFY.ai company's  today IT infrastructure,customer services and cloud strategy. Jiffy.ai is an artificial intelligence (AI) and automation platform provider founded in 2018. Jiffy.ai offers an AI-powered automation platform that combines technologies such as robotic process automation (RPA), artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML). The platform enables businesses to automate repetitive tasks, optimize processes, and improve productivity.

### Current IT Set Up Of Jiffy.AI
______________________

Currently, the infrastructure for the Company is located on-site.For Jiffy.ai, 80 employees are employed. They are using machine learning (ML), robotic process automation (RPA), and artificial intelligence (AI) to build their software applications. Certain virtual machine technologies exist in the cloud.In essence, they are building everything in a private cloud setting, and they have chosen Microsoft Azure as their cloud service provider.

## Contrast of cloud and non-cloud solutions 
--------------------------------------------
A cloud-ready application's deployment architecture is always influenced by the services the cloud vendor provides. For an application that must run under rigorous compliance and data residency regulations, the selection of cloud services becomes even more important.

### Cloud
_________
- Scalability & Flexibility
- Cost-effectiveness
- Reliability and Availability
- Security & Elasticity
- Collaboration and Sharing
- Updates to software are automated

### Non-Cloud 
_____________
- Organizations have complete control over their infrastructure, including hardware, software, and data.
- High levels of security and discretion.
- Performing the backups regularly and on a regular basis.
- Maintenance is challenging.

## Cloud Storage VS On-Premises Storage 
__________________________________________
Whether to preserve their data on internal or external servers is a critical decision that firms must make. When comparing the benefits and drawbacks of on-premises versus cloud storage, it's important to be aware of the main distinctions between the two types of storage.

## Advantages of On Premises Storage 
-------------------------------------
- Provides organizations with complete control over their data.They can put their own security measures, encryption methods, and access controls in place because they have direct physical access to the storage infrastructure. For businesses handling sensitive or regulated data, this level of control can be especially beneficial.

- By keeping data on-site and putting security measures in place in accordance with certain regulatory standards, on-premise storage enables businesses to assure compliance.

- With on-site storage, businesses may customize their storage infrastructure to meet their unique requirements. They have the option of selecting hardware elements, storage setups, and software programs that best suit their needs. 

## Why using on-site storage might not be the best choice?
___________________________________________________________
- Costs up front and ongoing: Hardware, software licenses, infrastructure setup, and maintenance are frequently major upfront expenses associated with on-site storage. The expense of purchasing, installing, and maintaining storage equipment as well as the recruiting and training of IT employees to administer and maintain the infrastructure must all be budgeted for by organizations.

- Limitations in Data Security and Redundancy: In comparison to trustworthy cloud storage services, on-site storage may have restrictions regarding data redundancy and security. Cloud storage solutions frequently make use of sophisticated data replication strategies, strong security measures, and encryption mechanisms.

- Limited Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery: Compared to cloud storage options, on-site storage may not offer as strong a level of business continuity and disaster recovery. Although businesses can set up backup and recovery procedures with on-site storage, they might have trouble duplicating data to remote sites or ensuring smooth failover in the event of hardware failures, calamities, or other disturbances.

## Microsoft Azure services Small and Medium-sized Enterprises
_______________________________________________________________
Cloud computing has developed into a vital tool not just in the business world but also in our everyday life. Since cloud computing is more trustworthy and secure, especially for inventory management, the majority of businesses have made this decision.With Microsoft Azure , projects and data may be stored and easily accessed on demand through cloud computing.Using Microsoft Azure, which is at the forefront of offering cloud computing services globally.The platform now allows customers to store data there.

## Cloud architecture deployment proposed
__________________________________________

A cloud-ready application's deployment architecture is always influenced by the services provided by the cloud vendor. When a specific application must function under rigorous compliance and data residency rules, the decision of which cloud services to use becomes more important.

## Why is Microsoft Azure the best choice?

- The existing IT environment and Microsoft Azure seamlessly connect. It offers a protected hybrid database, data residency, storage options, and Azure Stack (Azure style of application development), leading to an expanded IT infrastructure, lower costs, and increased flexibility. Businesses are switching to Microsoft Azure as a result of these scalable offerings.
  
- The availability of Microsoft-managed datacenters in 26 areas across the world gives businesses and developers plenty of opportunity to create and run apps for the great majority of their clientele.

## Conclusion
______________

The infrastructure of Jiffy.Ai includes both cloud and non-cloud terms. We assessed their IT operations and offered a number of cloud-based options to improve performance at a fair price. I have seen that there are some specific areas, like hosting and project management, where no recommendations are made since they are satisfied with their current selection.
